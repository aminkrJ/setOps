  "description": "setOps.js ========= Set operations in `setOps.js` take two arrays and return the result of the operation as an array. Supported operations are `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, `complement`, and `equals`. `difference` is the _symmetric difference_ and `complement` is the _relative complement_. The set operations are fast, even for large arrays.",
